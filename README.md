# Advanced-Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis-With-SQL-in-Laptop-Dataset

Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of laptops to extract meaningful insights about laptop specifications, pricing trends, and feature distributions. The dataset includes various attributes such as company, CPU and GPU specifications, RAM, storage, screen resolution, touchscreen capability, weight, and price.

Dataset Schema

The dataset consists of the following columns:

Company (text) - Brand of the laptop

TypeName (text) - Category/type of the laptop

Inches (double) - Screen size in inches

resolution_width (int) - Width of the screen resolution

resolution_height (int) - Height of the screen resolution

touchscreen (int) - Indicates if the laptop has a touchscreen (1 for Yes, 0 for No)

cpu_brand (varchar) - Brand of the CPU

cpu_name (varchar) - Model name of the CPU

cpu_speed (decimal) - Speed of the CPU in GHz

Ram (int) - RAM size in GB

memory_type (varchar) - Type of storage (SSD, HDD, Hybrid, Flash Storage)

primary_storage (int) - Primary storage capacity in GB

secondary_storage (int) - Secondary storage capacity in GB (if available)

gpu_brand (varchar) - Brand of the GPU

gpu_name (varchar) - Model name of the GPU

OpSys (text) - Operating system of the laptop

Weight (decimal) - Weight of the laptop in kg

Price (double) - Price of the laptop in USD

Data Cleaning and Transformation

Backup Creation

A backup of the laptop table was created to preserve raw data.

Data Type Adjustments

Ram and Weight were converted to integer and decimal types respectively after removing units (GB, kg).

Feature Extraction

cpu_brand, cpu_name, and cpu_speed were extracted from Cpu column and the original column was dropped.

gpu_brand and gpu_name were extracted from Gpu column and the original column was dropped.

resolution_width, resolution_height, and touchscreen were extracted from ScreenResolution and the original column was dropped.

memory_type, primary_storage, and secondary_storage were extracted from Memory column and the original column was dropped.

Storage Standardization

All storage values were converted to GB for consistency.
